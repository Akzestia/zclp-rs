### **User Registry**
- **Definition**: The User Registry is a centralized database of users, hosted on official servers. It simplifies the authentication process by maintaining a single, unified registry across all clusters.
  
- **Benefits**:
  - **Reduced Complexity**: There's no need to manage separate authentication registries for each cluster, which would otherwise lead to increased complexity and overhead.
  - **Optimized Communication**: By centralizing user data, the need for cross-cluster communication is minimized, improving performance and reducing potential points of failure.
  - **Scalability**: Centralized user management allows for easier scaling, as user data is handled in one place, making it more efficient and easier to maintain as the system grows.
  
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Hosting the User Registry on official servers ensures better control and oversight over security practices and updates.
  - Centralized authentication also helps in enforcing consistent security measures across all clusters.

This centralized approach benefits both performance and security, as users only need to authenticate once, regardless of which cluster they are connecting to.
