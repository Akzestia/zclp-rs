### **Cluster Registry**
- **Definition**: A centralized service or database that holds a list of all available clusters. It provides users the ability to choose from different clusters at the time of application startup, simplifying cluster management and user selection.

### **Official Clusters**
- **Description**: These clusters are hosted and maintained by the development team of the **ずるい** application. 
- **Guarantees**:
  - These clusters run official releases of the application.
  - Code and services are verified and maintained by the official dev team, ensuring stability and consistency.
- **Transparency**: 
  - The source code and the list of services running on these clusters are publicly available on platforms like GitHub. This allows users to view and contribute to the development of the official release.
  
### **Community Clusters**
- **Description**: These clusters are hosted by the community, meaning individual users or groups of users are responsible for managing the infrastructure.
- **Caution**:
  - These clusters **may not** run official code. There is no guarantee that the code running on these clusters hasn’t been modified by the hosting party.
  - As such, users are advised to use these clusters with caution, as the safety, security, and integrity of the services can't be assured.
- **Flexibility**: Community clusters might offer additional customizations, features, or configurations that are not present in official clusters.
